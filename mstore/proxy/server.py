# NOTE: mstore_conn
# You'll see mstore_conn passed around a few places in this file. This is the
# source httplib connection of whatever it is attached to.
#   It is used when early termination of reading from the connection should
# happen, such as when a range request is satisfied but there's still more the
# source connection would like to send. To prevent having to read all the data
# that could be left, the source connection can be .close() and then reads
# commence to empty out any buffers.
#   These shenanigans are to ensure all related objects can be garbage
# collected. We've seen objects hang around forever otherwise.
